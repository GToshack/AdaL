          <h2>Her contributions to Computer Science</h2>
            <p> 
                She is considered the first computer programmer<br>
                First person to see a numerical computational device to have so much more potential.
                She first gained prevalence in the scientific community with her translation of a paper about Charles Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine, where her notes and insight nearly tripled its length (She was 27).<img src="https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mg20827915.500-1_300.jpg"><br>
                Her notes exhaustively discussed how a computer would or could be programmed.
                She stipulated that computers could be used for more than numbers, an idea that was not furthered until more than a century later.<br>
                Ada wrote the first well-known computer algorithm<br>
                    - Her algorithm computed bernoulli numbers<br>
                Her notes were used by Alan Turing to create the first true computer during WW2.
