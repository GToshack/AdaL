        <h1> Who was Ada Lovelace?</h1> 
          <h2>Ada King, Countess of Lovelace</h2>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <p> Only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron and his wife of a year Annabella Milbanke.<br>
                <br>
                Her father left her mother a few weeks after she was born.<br><br>
                Her mother raised her and taught her maths, science, and logic, in an effort to distract her from becoming anything like her father.<br><br>
                She had been introduced to Mary Somerville in her youth and was tutored by her.<br><br>
                She married at the age of 19 William King, who was an earl.<br><br>
                They had 3 kids together.<br><br>
                She attempted to use her intellect to win gambling, but ended up with serious debt.<br><br>
                She first used opium recreationally, but later turned to it for relief from her terminal cancer.<br><br>
                She had an IQ equal to that of Steven Hawking and Albert Einstein.<br><br>
                Ada Lovelace day is on the second Tuesday of October.<br>
